PaySuper Webhook Notifier is a RabbitMQ consumer that sends the PaySuper notifications to projects.

The PaySuper system can send notifications to the project for a set of events during the flow, such as creating new accounts or transaction flow, making payouts, and so on.

In most cases, webhooks are triggered by user actions on your website or by back-end related events like a successful payment, a refund payment and other.

***

## Example of notifications:

1. A request of a payment complete.
2. A request of a refund complete.
